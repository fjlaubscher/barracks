      <h4>Why?</h4>
      <p>
        Barracks is a personal project, fueled by my passion for software development, and of
        course, Bolt Action.
        <br /> While the app currently focuses on rules references and army building, it is an
        evolving endeavor.
        <br />
        Your feedback, contributions, and feature requests are crucial in shaping its future
        development.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Data privacy is a top priority for me while developing Barracks.
        <br />
        The app does not store any personal information anywhere.
        <br />
        <br />
        Army lists are stored locally on your device, unless created publicly.
        <br /> When choosing to create (and sync) public army lists, the data is stored on a
        Cloudflare Worker and associated with a your unique Google account identifier.
        <br />
        <br />
        No email addresses, no personal information.
