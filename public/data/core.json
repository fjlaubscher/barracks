This makes flamethrowers especially effective against troops in bunkers or behind cover, as well as troops lying flat on the ground, which is not a good defence against flaming liquids being sprayed on the area.<br/>If you score a hit with a flamethrower the number of hits is multiplied into D6 (or D6+1 in the case ofvehicle-mounted flamethrower). Roll for damage in the usual manner.<br/>Flamethrowers always hit the top armour of vehicles - this represents the tendency of burning liquid to seep through hatches and other openings. Also, flamethrowers don't rely on kinetic energy to penetrate a target's armour, so they don't suffer the -1 Pen penalty when firing at long range.<br/><br/>The gun shield rule does not apply when shooting at artillery targets with a flamethrower. The extra protection rule does not apply when shooting at targets inside buildings with a flamethrower. In both cases neither building nor gun shield offers any additional protection against a flamethrower. Any unit hit by a flamethrower takes 1 pin marker because it has been hit, and a further D3 pin markers to account for the unbridled terror unleashed upon it, for a total of D3+1 pin markers on the target. The target of a flamethrower must always check its morale once firing has been worked out and pin markers allocated as described above. Note that a morale check is required regardless of the number of casualties caused and even if no damage has been suffered at all. A unit failing this check is destroyed immediately - its morale completely shattered. Vehicles failing their morale in this way are abandoned and considered destroyed.<br/><br/>After shooting with an infantry man-pack flamethrower, roll a D6. On a result of 1 the flamethrower has run out of fuel and is now useless. If this happens the entire flamethrower team is removed as if it had fallen casualty. Although this might seem harsh, it does reflect the extreme risks run by troops carrying flamethrowers and introduces a level of unpredictability that balances the weapon's effectiveness. After shooting with a vehicle-mounted flamethrower, roll a D6 (or a dice for each flamethrower if the vehicle has more than one). On a result of 1 that flamethrower has run out of fuel and is now useless. This does not otherwise affect the vehicle. When rolling on the damage effects chart against a vehicle equipped with flamethrowers, add an extra +1 to the roll to represent the increased risk from carrying around so much volatile fuel for the flamethrower."

        "name": "HE (High Explosive)",
        "description": "The HE rule refers to weapons that can fire a high explosive shot. Some weapons, for instance anti-tank guns, can fire either anti-tank shots (using the Pen value indicated) or HE shots. The player must declare which type of shot the weapon is firing as he declares the target. Some weapons can only fire HE shots and their Pen value is indicated as HE.<br/><br/>The number in bracket after the HE shows how powerful the shell is and therefore how large its explosion is going to be, rated from 1-4\" in diameter (see the chart below). When firing an HE weapon, pick a target unit and roll to hit in the same way as for a normal shot. If the target is hit by an HE shot, you then need to use the appropriate template to determine how many models in the unit have been hit. First pick a point to place the centre of the template on. This can be anywhere on top of, or between the target unit's models, so that the template covers as many models as possible in the target unit (including a point that is out of sight and/or range), but the template cannot clip any friendly models.<br/>Note that if a weapon team or artillery unit has been mounted on a single collective base, you should imagine that each model has an individual 25mm round base when placing the template.<br/><br/>Once the template is in position, count the number of models whose bases are under the template (even partially) - that is the number of hits caused on the target unit. It is of course possible, especially with large explosions, to clip models from other enemy units nearby. Each unit hit suffers a number of hits equal to the number of its models that are under the template. Note that a 1\" template placed between two models of the same unit that are just spaced out as much as much as possible can always hit two models at a minimum.<br/><br/>A unit shot at by HE can react by taking an immediate Down action in the usual manner. Once the unit has gone <i>Down</>, roll to hit, place the template and determine the number of HE hits caused normally, but then halve that number, rounding up.<br/>HE hits don't cause a single pin marker on the target, but rather a variable number of pin markers.<br/><br/>Roll to damage as normal, starting from the target unit and then rolling for other units hit in any order you like. The penetration value of HE shells, which is applied on the roll to damage for all targets hit, also varies with the HE values - larger and more powerful shells having higher values.<br/><br/>HE don't suffer the -1 penetration penalty when hitting an armoured target at long range. Note that the models removed as casualties can come from anywhere in the unit, not just from the models within the explosion radius.<br/><br/>When a unit capable of shooting HE or anti-tank shots is given an <i>Ambush</i> order the player must specify the kind of round loaded. If this is forgotten then the default position is that anti-tank guns will load anti-tank rounds, whilst other guns will load HE rounds. The unit cannot change from one type of round to another until a further order is issued, though this could be another <i>Ambush</i> order if desired."

When firing over open sights it has no minimum range. When using indirect fire, a howitzer has a minimum range. This is shown in brackets on the weapon chart - for example, light howitzers have a minimum range of 0-24\". If a howitzer switches from indirect fire to direct fire and then returns to indirect fire, always against the same target, the zeroing-in sequence is reset."

        "description": "Indirect fire weapons cannot be fired at targets within their minimum range (see weapon profiles), measured from the centre of the weapon itself. If a target is found to be within this minimum range the shot misses automatically and is ignored. The crew of an indirect firing weapon must still be able to see their target unit to shoot, unless a spotter is employed. However, the crew can direct their fire against a target even if friends are in the way, as shots pass far over the heads of intervening friendly troops because of the high trajectory.<br/><br/>When firing HE shells using indirect fire, a 6 is required to hit, regardless of any modifier. In the following turn, if the shooter fires at the same target unit, and if the shooter has not moved from their position (i.e. it receives a <i>Fire</i> order), and if the target unit has not moved from their position (to count as 'moved', the entire unit must be at least 2\" away from the area that it was covering before), a hit is scored on a <strong>5+</strong>. This represents the shooter adjusting his aim by observing where shots are falling. If the shooter continues to fire under the same conditions explained above, a hit is scored on a <strong>4+</strong> in the next turn, then <strong>3+</strong> and finally <strong>2+</strong> in all subsequent turns. However, if a hit is scored in any turn, the shooter is zeroed in on the target and as long as it does not move, all further shots hit on <strong>2+</strong>, even if the target unit is then lost from view (obscured by a moving vehicle, a spotter is killed, etc.).<br/><br/>When fired against vehicles, hits from indirect fire weapons always strike the vulnerable top armour, counting the <strong>+1</strong> penetration modifier to damage regardless of the actual position of the firer. If an open-topped armoured vehicle is hit by indirect fire add the <strong>+1</strong> penetration modifier to the roll to damage, and also add <strong>+1</strong> to the die roll on the damage results table.<br/><br/>Weapons cannot be fired indirectly by a unit that was in <i>Ambush</i> that turn - indirect fire takes time. Howitzers and mortars can also fire smoke shells to lay a smoke screen.<br/><br/>If a unit includes both normal weapons and indirect firing weapons (such as one or more light mortars inside a unit of riflemen), any mortar in the squad can pick a target individually, regardless of what the rifles and other mortars in the squad are doing.<br/>Ranging in is kept track of separately for each mortar."

        "name": "Spotters",
        "description": "Some indirect weapons teams can be provided with a spotter as indicated in the Army Lists section. A spotter is always a single model. The spotter is part of the mortar or artillery team but is always treated separately and is not one of the crew. He does not have to be placed with the weapon crew - his role is to lie in some forward position from where he can relay target coordinates to the crew, directing their fire using either a radio or fixed line. As the spotter forms part of the same unit as the weapon he is directing, no separate order die is provided for him (this also means that when you count the number of units in your army, the spotter and gun count as one). During a turn either the weapon crew can be given an order or the spotter can be given an order - but never both. Spotters can never assault or fire against enemy units. Note however that a spotter that does not have an order die next to it always counts as <i>Down</i> (as it would indeed lie flat on the ground for most of the time except when moving).<br/><br/>If an indirect fire weapon is fired by veteran or regular crew, and it has a spotter, then the crew are assumed to be able to see whatever the spotter can see. This can potentially enable a mortar or artillery piece to shoot at targets that lie on the other side of a hill, woods or in some other position that is invisible to the crew itself."

If you find that there is a friendly unit within 6\" of the original template, you cannot fire and the shot is wasted.<br/><br/>Once the target units have been determined, check if any of these units are within the minimum range - these units are missed automatically. Then roll to hit for all remaining target units, one at a time in any order you prefer, hitting on 6. If you score one or more hits, work out the total of all of the hits inflicted by the salvo on target units, using the relevant templates, and then proceed to roll to damage.

All the crew members are fully occupied whether carrying equipment, serving the weapon, or keeping watch.<br/>A team weapon shoots at full effectiveness so long as there are at least two men to serve it.

Choose which model becomes the loader - you can pick any model in the squad except the NCO, and you must mark this model clearly, so that both you and the opponent can easily recognise it. Then keep the loader within an inch of the weapon-carrying model at all times. When the team weapon is fired, the loader cannot fire his own personal weapon.<br/><br/>If an infantry squad's team weapon is destroyed, the surviving loader simply reverts to an ordinary member of the squad. If the loader is killed or is not within an inch of the firer, the weapon suffers a -1 'to hit' penalty as described above."

These exceptions are indicated in the Army Lists. If they fail an order test, these vehicles will always reverse at a Run rate. Recce vehicles will also spot hidden enemy at longer ranges than other vehicles.<br/><br/><strong>Escape Reaction</strong><br/>Unlike other vehicles, recce vehicles that are shot at can react, as long as they have taken no other action that turn yet. This is the same as described for an infantry or artillery unit reacting by going <i>Down</i> when shot at, except that before going <i>Down</i>, the recce vehicle makes an escape reaction.<br/>An escape reaction is a move at Advance or Run rate, which may be forward or reverse, as long as it results in the escaping vehicle ending out of sight of the attacking enemy, or in cover from the attack, or at least further away from the attacker than when the attack is declared.In other words, this move cannot be used to move closer to the attacker. It also cannot be used to assault enemy units if the escaping vehicle is a tank. Once the escape move is done, mark the vehicle as Down, just as if the recce vehicle had failed an order test.<br/><br/>The enemy's shot is then resolved as normal. If the target has moved out of range or sight then the unit shoots and automatically misses. Note that if firing at a recce vehicle with HE, first determine whether the recce vehicle would be hit by the explosion and then decide to escape or not, just like a unit deciding to go <i>Down</i> when hit by HE.<br/><br/>When an enemy unit declares an assault against a recce vehicle that has taken no action yet that turn, the vehicle may react with an escape as described above. If the recce vehicle decides not to escape, then it can react by shooting at the assaulting unit (if allowed to do so), as normal. After the escape move is done, measure the range from the assaulting unit. If the unit is out of range, the assaulting unit must simply run towards the vehicle. If the assault succeeds, the assault is resolved as normal (assaulting infantry hits on 6, even if the reverse move was done at Run speed).<br/>Recce vehicles cannot react with an escape if they are towing anything. Also, recce vehicles cannot react with an escape to an air strike or artillery barrage, as the artillery barrage does not target the vehicle directly, and the air strike does not require line of sight from the attacking plane and does not roll to hit, instead hitting automatically."
